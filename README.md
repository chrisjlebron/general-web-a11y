General Web Accessibility
=========================

If you're reading this, you're like me:

1. interested in making content on the Web accessible to all, regardless of device or ability, and
2. perplexed by the lack of dedicated resources toward that end.

Sure, there are great places to find a ton of info about accessibility (see [WCAG][], [WebAIM][], [456 Berea St.][], [Web Axe][], and [the rest](#bookmarks)), but very few with a low barrier for entry__*__. What I hope to do with this repo is collect some general best practices for web accessibility, along with accompanying code/hacks (where necessary), and keep it all clean and easy to read and reference. This is not going to be exhaustive, even in its final form; that's what [those other sites](#bookmarks) are for. This will be more of a springboard, a quick reference guide, a checklist helper, a reminder, a [fist-bump][]...

__*__ _The main barrier I'm speaking of here being [TL;DR][], and the other being that 1998 called and they want their Web Design back! OOH! ZING! SNAP! BAng - uh, ahem... Seriously though, it's difficult enough to sift through all the info on--for instance--the WebAIM site, let alone doing so while staring at a site which doesn't take into account any modern UI/UX design techniques. I find the designs of some of these sites actually hinder overall accessibility for sighted users._

## What is "Accessibility"?

Accessibility doesn't just mean making the web friendly for people using screenreaders. It's also about making your sites easily navigable (e.g., by keyboard or a [switch][]), offering translations for folks who don't speak your language, creating mobile versions of your sites that [don't suck][], considering our __color-deficient__ friends, and designing [intuitive user experiences][].

## Guidelines for Making Pull Requests

Want to contribute to the project? Want to add a reference or bookmark? Think I made a mistake? Feel free to open an [issue](/issues) or make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). I only have a few __guidelines__:

+ Please try to back up your changes/additions with reference links, if possible.
+ If you can provide more than one reference, even better!
+ When contributing code, please include a link to an example usage, preferrably as a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/). Some useful apps for sharing such test cases:
    + [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) (allows use of preprocessors and other goodies)
    + [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) (a classic)
    + [dabblet](http://dabblet.com/) (focus on CSS & HTML)
    + or even [Dropbox](http://lifehacker.com/5528104/use-dropbox-to-share-and-host-your-web-site)
+ Don't be afraid to open up a dialog; I love talking about the Web.
